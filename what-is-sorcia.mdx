## Overview

Sorcia is an **AI-powered enterprise knowledge base** that acts as a single source of truth for all your company's information. It connects to your existing tools—like Slack, Notion, Google Drive, GitHub, and more—and uses AI to help your team find answers instantly.

<Note>
  Think of Sorcia as having a knowledgeable coworker who has read every document, message, and file in your company and can answer any question in seconds.
</Note>

## The Problem We Solve

Modern teams use dozens of tools to collaborate and store information:

- **Slack** for conversations
- **Notion** for documentation  
- **Google Drive** for files
- **GitHub** for code
- **Confluence** for wikis

This creates several challenges:

<Warning>
  **Information Silos** - Knowledge is scattered across multiple platforms  
  **Context Switching** - Teams waste hours searching different tools  
  **Onboarding Friction** - New hires struggle to find information  
  **Lost Knowledge** - Important information gets buried or forgotten
</Warning>

## How Sorcia Helps

Sorcia solves these problems by:

### 1. **Connecting Everything**

Sorcia integrates with your existing tools through secure OAuth connections. No migration required—your data stays where it is.

    E --> F[AI-Powered Answers]
```

### 2. **Understanding Context**

Using advanced AI and embeddings, Sorcia understands the meaning and context of your questions, not just keywords.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Example Question
/sorcia How do I submit expense reports?
```

```markdown Sorcia Response
Based on your company's Expense Policy (Google Drive) and recent 
conversations in #finance (Slack):

1. Fill out the Expense Report form
2. Attach receipts
3. Submit via the Finance Portal
4. Approvals typically take 2-3 days

Sources: Expense Policy v2.4 (Google Drive), #finance conversation (Slack)
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. **Maintaining Security**

Every answer respects your existing permissions. If you can't access a document in Google Drive, Sorcia won't show it in results.

<Check>
  **Permission-Aware** - Only shows documents you have access to  
  **Row-Level Security** - Organization-scoped data isolation  
  **Audit Logs** - Track every query for compliance  
  **SOC 2 Ready** - Enterprise-grade security architecture
