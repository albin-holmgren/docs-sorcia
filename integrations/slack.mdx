<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Workspace">
    Choose which Slack workspace to connect

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Success!** Sorcia is now installed in your Slack workspace.

### Step 3: Configure Sync Settings

  - users:read           # User directory
  - users:read.email     # Email addresses
  - files:read           # Access shared files

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slash command not working">
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify Sorcia is installed in your workspace
    - Check you're in a channel where Sorcia is invited
    - Re-authorize the Slack integration
    - Contact support if persists
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No results from Slack">
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify channels are selected in sync settings
    - Wait 5-10 minutes for initial sync to complete
    - Check channel permissions (must be public or Sorcia invited)
    - Review sync logs for errors
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing private channel messages">
    **Solution**: Invite `@Sorcia` to the private channel:
    ```
    /invite @Sorcia
    ```
    Then wait for sync to complete (1-2 minutes)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Responses are slow">
    **Causes**:
    - Large workspace (> 10K messages)
    - Complex questions requiring multiple sources
    - High API load (upgrade plan for faster processing)
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Use filters to narrow search scope
    - Upgrade to Pro/Enterprise for better performance
