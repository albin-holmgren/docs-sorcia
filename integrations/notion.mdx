```

## Permissions

Sorcia respects Notion's permission model:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Workspace Pages">
    Visible to all workspace members
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Shared Pages">
    Only visible to users with access
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Private Pages">
    Must be explicitly shared with Sorcia
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  Users only see Notion pages they have access to in the original workspace.
</Info>

## Sync Behavior

### Initial Sync

- **Small workspace** (< 100 pages): 2-5 minutes
- **Medium workspace** (100-1,000 pages): 5-15 minutes  
- **Large workspace** (> 1,000 pages): 15-30 minutes

### Real-Time Updates

Changes sync via webhooks:
- Page edited → Updates within 60 seconds
- Page created → Indexed immediately
- Page deleted → Removed from search
- Permissions changed → Access updated

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pages not appearing">
    - Verify page is shared with Sorcia integration
    - Check page isn't in excluded list
    - Wait for sync to complete (check status)
    - Try manual re-sync
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission errors">
    - Re-authorize Notion integration
    - Verify workspace admin permissions
    - Check page sharing settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Slow sync">
    - Normal for large workspaces
    - Sync runs in background
    - Can query available pages immediately
  </Accordion>
