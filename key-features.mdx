## 🤖 AI-Powered Search

Go beyond keyword matching with intelligent, context-aware search.

### Hybrid Search Engine

Sorcia combines three search methods for superior accuracy:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Question] --> B[Vector Search]
    A --> C[Full-Text Search]
    A --> D[Metadata Filters]
    B --> E[Ranked Results]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    E --> F[AI-Generated Answer]
```

<Accordion title="Vector Search (Semantic)">
  Uses AI embeddings to understand meaning and context. Finds documents even when they use different words.
  
  **Example**: Searching "PTO" finds documents about "vacation policy" and "time off"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Full-Text Search (Keyword)">
  Traditional search for exact matches and technical terms. Perfect for finding specific names, codes, or IDs.
  
  **Example**: Searching "JIRA-1234" finds that exact ticket
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Metadata Filters">
  Narrow results by source, date, author, or custom properties.
  
  **Example**: "sales metrics from last quarter in Google Sheets"
</Accordion>

### Answer Quality

Every answer includes:

- **Source Citations** - See exactly where information came from
- **Confidence Score** - Know how certain the AI is about the answer
- **Related Questions** - Discover connected information
- **Follow-up Suggestions** - Dig deeper with one click

<CodeGroup>

```bash User Question
How do we handle customer refunds?
```

```markdown Sorcia Response
Based on your Customer Support Handbook (Notion) and #support-team 
conversations (Slack):

**Standard Refund Process:**
1. Verify purchase within refund window (30 days)
2. Confirm customer identity via email
3. Process refund through Stripe dashboard
4. Update ticket status to "Refunded"

**Special Cases:**
- Enterprise customers: Requires manager approval
- Amounts over $1,000: Finance team review needed
- Outside refund window: Escalate to support lead

**Sources:**
- Customer Support Handbook v3.2 (Notion)
- #support-team discussion on 2024-10-15 (Slack)
- Finance Policy Q4 2024 (Google Drive)

Confidence: 95%

## 🔒 Enterprise Security

Security isn't an afterthought—it's built into every layer of Sorcia.

### Permission-Aware Retrieval

<Steps>
  <Step title="Permission Sync">
    When you connect an integration, Sorcia syncs all access control lists (ACLs)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Query Filtering">
    Every search automatically filters results based on your permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Real-Time Updates">
    When permissions change in the source system, Sorcia updates immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Result**: Users only see documents they're authorized to access, just like in the original system.
</Check>

## ⚡ Real-Time Sync

Stay up-to-date without manual refreshes.

### How Sync Works

1. **Initial Index** - Full sync when you first connect an integration
2. **Webhooks** - Real-time updates when documents change
3. **Scheduled Refresh** - Daily checks for changes in sources without webhooks
4. **On-Demand Sync** - Manual re-sync anytime from the dashboard

<Info>
  **Sync Status**: Monitor sync progress in real-time from the Integrations page
</Info>

### Sync Performance

| Workspace Size | Initial Sync | Incremental Updates |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Small (< 1K docs) | 2-5 minutes | < 30 seconds |
| Medium (1K-10K) | 10-30 minutes | < 2 minutes |
| Large (> 10K) | 1-2 hours | < 5 minutes |
