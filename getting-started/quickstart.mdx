  <Tab title="Notion">
    1. Click **Integrations** in the sidebar
    2. Click **Connect** on the Notion card
    3. Select your Notion workspace
    4. Choose which pages to give Sorcia access to
    5. Click **Allow access**
    
    <Check>Your Notion workspace is now connected!</Check>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Google Drive">
    1. Click **Integrations** in the sidebar
    2. Click **Connect** on the Google Drive card
    3. Sign in with your Google account
    4. Grant Sorcia read-only access
    5. Click **Allow**
    
    <Check>Your Google Drive is now connected!</Check>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  You can connect multiple integrations! Each one takes about 2 minutes to set up.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Wait for Initial Sync

After connecting an integration, Sorcia will automatically index your documents.

<Info>
  **Sync Times**:
  - Small workspace (< 1,000 docs): 2-5 minutes
  - Medium workspace (1,000-10,000 docs): 10-30 minutes
  - Large workspace (> 10,000 docs): 1-2 hours
  
  You can start asking questions as soon as the first documents are indexed!
</Info>

You can monitor sync progress in the **Integrations** page:

```bash
✓ Google Drive: 847 documents synced
⏳ Slack: 2,453 messages synced (in progress...)
```

## Step 4: Ask Your First Question

Now that you have documents indexed, let's ask a question!

### Option A: Web App

1. Click **Ask Sorcia** in the sidebar
2. Type your question in natural language
3. Press Enter or click Send

<CodeGroup>

```bash Example
What's our vacation policy?
```

```markdown Response
Based on your HR Handbook (Google Drive):

All full-time employees receive 20 days of paid time off (PTO) per year. 
PTO accrues monthly at 1.67 days per month.

Key points:
- Unused PTO can roll over up to 5 days
- Request time off at least 2 weeks in advance
- Check team calendar before booking vacation

**Sources:**
- Employee Handbook 2024 (Google Drive)
- #announcements - HR Update (Slack)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Option B: Slack Command

If you connected Slack, you can use the `/sorcia` command:

```bash
/sorcia What's our vacation policy?
```

Sorcia will respond directly in Slack with the answer and sources!

<Tip>
  Slack responses are **ephemeral** (only you can see them) by default for privacy.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Invite Your Team

Make Sorcia even more valuable by inviting your team:

1. Go to **Team Members** in the sidebar
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter their email address
4. Select their role (Member, Admin, or Owner)
5. Click **Send Invitation**

They'll receive an email with instructions to join your organization.

## Common First Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does it take to sync documents?">
    Initial sync time depends on the number of documents. Small workspaces (< 1,000 docs) typically complete in 2-5 minutes. You can start asking questions as soon as the first documents are indexed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I control which documents are indexed?">
    Yes! For each integration, you can specify which folders, channels, or spaces to sync. You can also exclude specific documents or patterns.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Who can see the answers?">
    Sorcia respects your existing permissions. If a user doesn't have access to a document in the source system (e.g., Google Drive), they won't see it in Sorcia results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    Sorcia offers a free tier for small teams (1 user, 1 integration, 100 questions/month). Paid plans start at $49/month. See [pricing](https://sorcia.ai/pricing) for details.
