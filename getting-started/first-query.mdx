## API Request

For programmatic access, use the Query API:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.sorcia.ai/api/ai/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

});

const data = await response.json();
console.log('Answer:', data.answer);
console.log('Sources:', data.citations);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.sorcia.ai/api/ai/query',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'},
    json={'question': 'What is our vacation policy?'}
)

data = response.json()
print('Answer:', data['answer'])
print('Confidence:', data['confidence'])
```

</CodeGroup>

## Understanding the Response

### Confidence Score

The confidence score indicates answer quality:

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 90-100% | Very confident | Trust the answer |
| 70-89% | Moderately confident | Verify with sources |
| 50-69% | Low confidence | Review sources carefully |
| < 50% | Very uncertain | Consider rephrasing question |

<Tip>
  Always check citations, especially for critical decisions

### Citations

Each citation includes:

- **Title** - Document name
- **Source** - Where it came from (Slack, Notion, etc.)
- **URL** - Direct link to original
